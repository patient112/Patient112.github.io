# Patient112 on Github 
## Follow the Journey
After 15 years of being a Registered Nurse, I am learning new skills to help me improve the world around me.  As I become more focused on coding and learning these skills, I will share my work here on Github.com as well here at
[patient112.github.io][def].

[def]: https://patient112.github.io/

### Items found here
Used as a dumping ground for student learning, this site will first function as a canvas for learning projects such as this very blog and repository.  Anything from "Hello World" tutorials to cat/dog classifiers and beyond could show up here.

As skills and understanding increase, there may be some meaninful projects appear, but until then, student level code and projects will rule the page.
